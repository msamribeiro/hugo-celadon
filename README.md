**Celadon** is a lightweight, responsive, one-page portfolio theme for [Hugo](https://gohugo.io). It is designed for **Academics**, **Data Scientists**, and **Creative Technologists**. It balances a rigorous publication list with a soft, "Morandi" color palette and modern grid layouts.

## ✨ Features

* **🎨 Morandi Design System:** A calm, high-contrast palette featuring Muted Teal, Warm Clay, and Cinnabar accents.
* **📜 One-Page Architecture:** A smooth-scrolling homepage that acts as a gateway to deep content.
* **🌙 Auto Dark Mode:** A sophisticated "Deep Slate" theme for low-light reading.
* **🧮 Academic Ready:** Native support for **KaTeX** (Math) and **Hugo Chroma** (Code Highlighting) with a "Gemini-style" copy interface.
* **🧩 Modular Sections:** Easily reorder sections (About, News, Research, Builds, Writing) via `hugo.toml`.
* **📱 Fully Responsive:** Collapsible layouts that look great on mobile and tablets.

## 📘 User Guide: Customizing Your Site

Celadon is designed to separate your **Content** (Markdown) from your **Homepage Layout** (Data).

### 1. Project Structure
Here is a map of what you should edit and what you can ignore.

```text
my-portfolio/
├── hugo.toml                <-- ⚙️ CONFIG: Menu, Title, Section ordering
├── content/                 <-- 📝 CONTENT: Your deep pages (Blogs, Papers)
│   ├── study/               
│   │   ├── _index.md        <-- Required for the section cover info
│   │   └── math-note.md     <-- Actual content page
│   └── _index.md            <-- Do not delete (Homepage entry point)
├── data/                    <-- 🗂️ HOMEPAGE DATA: Content for the main page cards
│   ├── news.yaml            <-- Matches "news" section
│   ├── research.yaml        <-- Matches "research" section
│   └── profile.yaml         <-- Your bio info
├── static/                  <-- 🖼️ ASSETS: Images, PDFs

│       └── ...
└── ...
```
### 2. Managing the Homepage

The homepage is built dynamically based on your configuration.

**Step 1: Define Sections** Open `hugo.toml`. Under `[params.homepage]`, the `sections` list determines what appears and in what order.

````toml
[params.homepage]
  sections = ["hero", "news", "research", "writing"]
````
**Step 2: Create Matching Data Files** For every item in that list (e.g., `"writing"`), Hugo looks for a matching YAML file in the `data/` folder (e.g., `data/writing.yaml`).

- *Note*: The naming is case-insensitive, but keeping them lowercase is recommended.

**Step 3: Choose the Layout** In `hugo.toml`, tell Celadon how to render that section:

```toml
[params.homepage.writing]
  enable = true
  title = "Selected Writing"
  layout = "grid"  # Options: "hero", "news", "cards", "grid"
```

### 3. Creating Deep Pages (Sub-pages)

To link a Homepage Card (e.g., "Study Notes") to a list of actual articles:

**3.1. Create the Folder Structure** Inside `content/`, create a folder that matches your topic. You must include an `_index.md` file for the list layout to work.

```text
content/
└── study/
    ├── _index.md       <-- The "List" page definition
    ├── note-01.md
    └── note-02.md
```

**3.2. Configure** `_index.md` This file defines the title and description users see when they click through.

```markdown
---
title: "Study Notes"
description: "My raw notes on math and code."
layout: "list"
---
(Welcome text here...)
```
**3.3. Add Articles** Inside the same folder, add your individual notes or articles as separate Markdown files.

```markdown
---
title: "Understanding Eigenvalues"
date: 2025-11-20
summary: "A deep dive into eigenvalues and their applications."
image: "/images/EigenArt.png"
tags: ["Math", "Linear Algebra"]
---
(Content of the article...)
``` 
**3.4. Link it from the Homepage** Open your data file (e.g., `data/writing.yaml`) and set the `link` property to the folder path.

```yaml
items:
  - title: "Study Notes"
    image: "/images/cover.jpg"
    link: "/study/"   <-- This points to content/study/_index.md
```

### 4. System Files (What to Ignore)
If you look inside themes/hugo-celadon/, you will see specific image files required for theme submission. You do not need to replace these unless you are forking the theme to release your own version.

- images/screenshot.png: Used by the Hugo Theme Gallery to preview the theme.

- images/tn.png: A thumbnail used by the Hugo Theme Gallery.

- layouts/: The logic engine. Don't touch unless you are a developer modifying the core code.

## Rich Text & Custom Labels

| Area | Field(s) | Rich Text Capabilities | Notes |
| - | - | - | - |
| Profile card (`data/profile.yaml`) | `title`, `summary`, `affiliation` | Inline HTML (`<br>`, `<em>`) + Markdown (`~~strike~~`, `**bold**`) | Rendered through `enrich-text`, so HTML/Markdown mixes safely. |
| News timeline (`data/news.yaml`) | `detail` | Markdown links `[text](url)` + inline formatting | Badges stay plain strings; only `detail` is enriched. |
| Research cards (`data/research.yaml`) | `summary`, `links`, `coauthors`, `coauthors_label` | Markdown summaries, standard YAML links, per-card label overrides | `coauthors_label`/`coauthorsLabel` replaces the default “Co-authors”. |

```yaml
# Profile

<!-- ## Rich Text in Profile + News

Both `data/profile.yaml` and `data/news.yaml` are rendered with `safeHTML`, so you can mix Markdown + inline HTML to highlight important bits.

### Supported Patterns

| Purpose          | Syntax in YAML (raw text)                                           | Notes                              |
|------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------|
| **Bold**         | `detail: "**Accepted** to CVPR 2025."`                              | Standard Markdown bold             |
| *Italic*         | `summary: "*Behavioral* + computational economics."`                | Standard Markdown italic           |
| Hyperlink        | `detail: "Joint work with [Kazuma Takakura](https://kazumatakakura.github.io/)"` | Markdown links auto-styled         |
| Highlight text   | `summary: "Exploring <mark>Bayesian incentives</mark> in markets."` | Uses hero highlight pill colors    |
| Accent in news   | `detail: "<span class=\"news-accent\">1st Place</span> Best Overall"` | Renders in accent color for news only |
| Line break       | `title: "Ph.D. Candidate • Economics<br>M.S. • Artificial Intelligence"` | Use `<br>` where you want the break |

### Example

```yaml
# data/profile.yaml
summary: >
  Interdisciplinary researcher studying <mark>network economics</mark> and
  <a href="/writing/">computational design</a>.
highlights:
  - "Co-led the <mark>Impact Lab</mark> fellowship."
  - "Published *Bayesian Incentives* in **Econometrica**."

# data/news.yaml
- date: "Nov 2025"
  detail: "Presented joint work with [Kazuma Takakura](https://kazumatakakura.github.io/) on innovation networks."
  badges: ["Talk"]

- date: "Apr 2025"
  detail: "<span class=\"news-accent\">1st place</span> Best Overall at [HackUSF 2025](https://devpost.com/software/skin-scan)."
  badges: ["Award"]

## 🤠 Favicon 

To customize the favicon, add your `favicon.ico` files to the `static/` directory of your Hugo site. You can generate a favicon using online tools like [favicon.io](https://favicon.io/). The files' name are automactically genreated via the tool. The file structure should look like this:

```text
static/
├─ android-chrome-192x192.png
├─ android-chrome-512x512.png
├─ apple-touch-icon.png
├─ favicon-16x16.png
├─ favicon-32x32.png
├─ favicon.ico
└─ site.webmanifest
```
